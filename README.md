			<h2>What is the Solar System?</h2>
			<p>The solar system refers to the system of celestial bodies that orbit around the Sun, a star located at the center of the system. The solar system consists of the eight planets, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as well as dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects.

The Sun is the largest object in the solar system and contains more than 99% of the total mass of the solar system. The planets, including Earth, are the most well-known and familiar objects in the solar system. They orbit the Sun in elliptical paths at different distances and speeds.

The solar system also contains the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune that is home to dwarf planets such as Pluto, and the Oort Cloud, a hypothesized region of icy bodies that surrounds the solar system. The study of the solar system is an important area of astronomy, as it provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as the search for extraterrestrial life...</p>
